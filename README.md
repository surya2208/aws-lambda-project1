#Serverless image processing using AWS Lambda
This project will use AWS Lambda to resize, crop, or filter images uploaded to an S3 bucket.

The Serverless Image Processing project aims to create an application that utilizes AWS Lambda to process and manipulate images uploaded to an S3 bucket. The main objective of this project is to resize, crop or filter the images automatically, using the powerful capabilities of AWS Lambda functions.

The application is built entirely in the AWS environment, taking advantage of the benefits of serverless computing, such as scalability, reduced cost, and ease of maintenance. The project's core features include image processing functionalities such as resizing, cropping, and filtering images based on user preferences.

The application will be triggered automatically whenever a new image is uploaded to the S3 bucket. The image will then be processed according to the specified image processing operation and the resulting image will be saved back to the S3 bucket. The processed image can then be retrieved from the S3 bucket and used for further purposes.

Overall, this project will demonstrate how to leverage the power of AWS Lambda to automate image processing tasks and improve the efficiency of image management processes.

Step 1: Create an S3 bucket

Login to AWS console and go to the S3 service.
Click "Create bucket" and give it a unique name.
Choose the region for your bucket and leave the other settings as default.
Step 2: Create an IAM role for your Lambda function

Go to the IAM service in the AWS console.
Click "Roles" and then "Create role".
Choose "Lambda" as the use case and click "Next".
Choose the permissions you want to give to your Lambda function. For this project, select the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy and click "Next".
Give your role a name and click "Create role".
Step 3: Create a Lambda function

Go to the Lambda service in the AWS console.
Click "Create function" and choose "Author from scratch".
Give your function a name, choose "Python 3.8" as the runtime, and choose the IAM role you created in step 2.
Click "Create function".
In the "Function code" section, copy and paste the following Python code:

#python

import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        s3.download_file(bucket, key, '/tmp/image.jpg')
        # Implement image processing here
        s3.upload_file('/tmp/processed.jpg', bucket, 'processed-' + key)
This code will be triggered when an image is uploaded to your S3 bucket. It will download the image, perform image processing, and upload the processed image to a new S3 object.
Step 4: Set up triggers

Click on "Add trigger" in the "Designer" section of your Lambda function.
Choose "S3" as the trigger type and choose the S3 bucket you created in step 1.
Set the event type to "ObjectCreated" and click "Add".
Step 5: Test your Lambda function

Upload an image to your S3 bucket.
Check the "processed-" object prefix in the S3 console. You should see a new object with the processed image.
That's it! You've successfully created a serverless image processing application using AWS Lambda.

Note: The image processing code is not included in this project. You will need to add the code to perform the desired image processing operations, such as resizing, cropping, or filtering. There are several Python libraries available for image processing, such as Pillow or OpenCV.
